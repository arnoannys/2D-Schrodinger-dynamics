# 2D-Schrodinger-dynamics
Efficient 2D Schr√∂dinger equation solver and it's use for simulating diffraction patterns from slit experiments. The first video below shows a double slit diffraction example at real time solution speed. The second video shows a pulse trapped in a circular potential well at real time solution speed.
